## Changelog for xHatter v1.4

- Added support for xStarbound's cosmetic underlays.
- Added support for faceable chest, legs and back items using the `"xHatter"` parameter. Hats may also use this parameter.
- If you're using xStarbound, using an Advanced Hatter or xHatter hat (or any hat with a custom sprite) as your base head is now more seamless â€” hats will be visually overlaid on the sprite now. Unlike regular underlays, this is visible to players using any client.
